/// ``maxHeight`` is read from the glyph's binary header (byte 1 of the glyph)
/// and is **unreliable** for total visual extent — descender lines marked
/// with `&` in the source are not counted by the original TheDraw editor.
/// Consumers should generally use:
///
/// - `lines.count` for the total number of rendered lines.
/// - `lines.count - (descender lines)` for true line-height/advance.
///
/// ## Width
///
/// ``maxWidth`` is declared `1..30` (`0x1E`) by the spec but is not validated
/// at the type level — callers and encoders are responsible for keeping the
/// value within range. Width is not always exactly observed either: a glyph
/// may contain shorter lines that end with `0x0D` before reaching maxWidth.

    /// documentation.

    /// than ``maxHeight`` entries when the glyph terminated early.
